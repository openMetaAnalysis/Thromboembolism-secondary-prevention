Venous thromboembolism secondary prevention
============================================
A living systematic review

Short url: https://openMetaAnalysis.github.io/Venous-thromboembolism-secondary-prevention

**Clinical summary:** This network meta-analysis of multiple treatment comparisons suggests that the most effective treatment is *x*. Heterogeneity of results as measured by I2 was '[moderate](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at XX%. This review updates the previously published meta-analysis.(1)

Meta-regression dooes not find modulators (year of publication, study size, event rate in the control groups) on the effect of the intervention.

**Methods overview:** This repository is an [openMetaAnalysis](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/) that combines methods of scoping, rapid, and living systematic reviews.  This analysis updates one or more previously published review(s) below. A comparison of studies included in this review compared to prior reviews are in the table, [reconciliation of trials included with prior meta-analyses/](files/reconciliation-tables/Reconciliation%20of%20studies.pdf). Newer studies included are listed in the references below. Rationale for newer trials excluded may be listed at the end of the references.
